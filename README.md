# Introduction

**Digital Quran** is a platform created by [Quran Academy](https://quranacademy.org) for the distribution of data related to the Quran. The mission of this project is to make the Noble Quran easily available everywhere by sharing all data that is prepared and published by Quran Academy. All developers of the websites and applications have to go through the same problems of finding, downloading, verifying various Quran related data: like translations, images, fonts, etc. Even if they do so there are still problems with keeping the information updated. The idea of this project is to develop and support common standards for Quran related information exchange and sharing of data texts, images, etc allowing people to concentrate on the core work itself.

## The project structure

The project consists of files sharing page and API. **Files sharing page** is just a web page where you can see and download any available data as a file. See the table below for data availability:

| Data type | Availability |
| :--- | :--- |
| Translations \(by ayah\) | Available and keep adding |
| Translations word-by-word | Available and keep adding |
| Quran word images \(i.e. this is text in image format that you can see at [Quran Academy](https://en.quranacademy.org/quran/2)\) | Preparing data |
| Quran audio | Future plans \(by surah, by ayah, by word\) |

We also have an **API**. You do not have to build your own Quranic back-end, we have done it for you :\) Instead you can just focus on your front-end or app side. [Get started](api/getting-started.md) with the API.

## Our principles

* **Halal!** How can something related to the Quran be not Halal? Have you ever thought about a way websites and mobile apps get all translations? Have you ever thought about a way Quranic websites and mobile apps get all translations? What if an author is not ok with the usage of his translation. Quran Academy values the authors' copyrights and encourages all developers to do so. Thus, all the content in the Digital Quran has detailed information about copyrights. Please do not ignore it!
* **Keep it up to date!** We all human beings doing mistakes and trying to improve our work and translators of the Quran are not an exception. That is why a translation may update. It is important to keep them up to date in order to provide people with better translations. But it is not easy to keep track of all translations. Do not worry! Digital Quran takes care of updating translations and other contents. All you need to do just sync with us regularly.
* **Do not duplicate!** We acknowledge all the tremendous work of our brothers and sisters that have been doing this work continuously. Our aim is not to duplicate the work but rather to consolidate all the best practices and data, share and keep them up to date.
* **Free!** No advertising! No paid content! The team of Quran Academy firmly believes that the Quran should be available to everyone, regardless of their financial situation. We also consider inadmissible indirect earning by including advertising from Google or other companies. So all the content is for free and without advertising. If you want to support the project financially you can donate.
* **ThawƒÅb \("reward"\) to everyone!** Quran Academy is a project of the ummah, not individuals. Therefore our goal is not only to provide content but also give an opportunity to earn a reward to everyone. A lot of content we provide is available because of the tremendous work of our volunteering brothers and sisters. We could hire someone but we also want you to get your reward. So feel free to join, if you want to contribute.
* **Keep in touch!** And at least, feel free for contact:\) If you found a mistake, have a suggestion, want to contribute, etc. Just write to our support email: [digitalquran@quranacademy.org](mailto:digitalquran@quranacademy.org). We will reply soon, in shaa Allah.
