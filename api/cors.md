# CORS

The API also supports [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing \(CORS\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) which allows cross-domain requests to be made by JavaScript on a web page. Otherwise such “cross-domain” requests would be forbidden by web browsers, per the [same origin security policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy).
