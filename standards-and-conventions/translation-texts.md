# Translation texts

Texts of translations are formatted in special standardized way:

* All translations texts are UTF-8 encoded.
* Quotation marks should be used conventional for the language — not straight quotes. Conventional quotation marks for each language are available [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark).
* Double\(--\) or triple hyphens \(---\) are replaced with a single em dash \(—\) with a white space before and after it. Single hyphen is used only for word connection, like in "follow-up" word. In such case hyphen has no white space before or after.
* The language's punctuation is used. For example, Farsi translation has Farsi comma, not Latin \(ANCII\).
* TODO: parenthesis, brackets, double brackets, footnotes...
