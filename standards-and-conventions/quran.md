# Quran

The Quran consists of 144 chapters called "surah". Each surah consists of verses called "ayah". Although the Quran is the same, there are different opinions on how to count ayahs and words in it. In nowadays, it can lead to some issues, like ambiguous referencing or technical issues like importing translations from sources with a different numbering system. Thus, it is important to stick with a standard. The accepted standard of Digital Quran is 6 236 ayah and 77 429 words, see more details below. 

{% hint style="info" %}
This standard is the most widely used and also is a standard of Corpus Quran project, so you can easily map our data with other project's data.

#### Surahs

There are 114 surahs in total. Surahs have different number of ayahs. The number of ayahs in a surah variate from 3 \(surahs 103, 108, and 110\) up to 286 \(the second surah\). The number of ayahs in a surah and the surah number are independent.

Each surah has a conventional name in Arabic. In a translated version of the Quran both transliterated name and translated name can be used. For example, the second surah is called البقرة which in an English translation can be presented like "The Cow" \(translation\) or "Al-Baqarah" \(transliteration\). Some surahs have non-conventional names as well but they are not considered in our sources.

Surahs are also of two types: Meccan and Medinan. In short, before and after the hijra from Mecca correspondingly.  


#### Ayahs

The accepted standard of Digital Quran is 6 236 ayahs. The main sources of differentiation on number of ayahs are the basmala and the mystery letters of Quran called the "Huroof-al-Muqattaat". In the used standard the basmala:

* In the first surah \(Al-Fatihah\): is a part of the surah and considered as the first ayah,
* In 9-th surah \(At-Tawbah\): is not presented, i.e. there is no basmala at the beginning of it at all,
* In all other surahs: it is presented but not considered as an ayah of the surah

 Ayahs consist of words. The number of words in an ayah variate from 1 up to 128 \(ayah 282 of the 2nd surah\). Read more about word bellow.

#### Words

The term "word" is special when it comes to the Quran. The accepted standard of Digital Quran is 77 429 words. Where by word we mean a part of the Medina mushaf text which is separated by white spaces with the only one exception:  the word "إل ياسين" \(Elijah\) in 130 ayah of 37 surah. Please, notice that such definition differs from what we usually mean by "word". For more details one can take a look at [Corpus Quran](http://corpus.quran.com/) project which give a good description for each "word" of the Quran.
