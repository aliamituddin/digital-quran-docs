## How can I contribute?

First of all, you can always make a dua ü§≤, which is the best support for us. 

The project is open for contribution because we value sharing of thawƒÅb \("reward"\). If you want to contribute just write an email to [digitalquran@quranacademy.org](mailto:digitalquran@quranacademy.org). Use "Digital Quran Contribution" in the subject to make it easier for us to find it. Add some details about yourself, your skills and how you would like to contribute. We will reply you back as soon as possible.

There are many different ways to support the project:

**Start using the platform and the standards.** Together, using and developing common standards and platforms, we can make Quranic apps and websites better, in sha'Allah. Instead of developing your standards and formats, let's develop common ones, so everyone could benefit. And this is all this project is about.

**Spread the word.** The more people involved, the more we all benefit. Talk about the project with your friends. Share the link in your social media accounts. Add a link to your website or app.

**Give us feedback.** Help us to make the standards and the content better. Tell us what you find helpful and how we can improve. Or just up-vote the issues that you are the most interested in seeing solved.

**Share content.** If you have Quranic content \(translation, tafseer, etc.\) which you can legally share, we would be glad to format it according to the standards and share it on Digital Quran.

**Help to format the content.** It is a lot of work to make existing translations to fit the standards. Many translations and tafseers are being formatted and validated manually before we can start to share them. So, we are looking forward to volunteers ready to help. With your help, we can share more content faster.
